# Task3: Simple & Multiple Linear Regression

**Overview**:
 
This repository contains the solution for Task 3 of the Elevate AI & ML Internship. The objective of this task was to implement and understand simple and multiple linear regression using Python and scikit-learn.

**Dataset**:

A sample dataset (can be Titanic, Housing, etc.) was used to demonstrate regression analysis by predicting a numeric target variable based on one or more features.

 **Tools and Libraries Used**
Python 3.x

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

**Task Steps**

1. Import and Preprocess the Dataset
Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

Cleaned and selected relevant numeric features for regression.

2. Train-Test Split
Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

3. Fit the Regression Model
Applied Simple Linear Regression using one feature.

Applied Multiple Linear Regression using several features.

4. Evaluate the Model
Calculated Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score to assess model performance.

5. Visualize and Interpret
Plotted the regression line using Matplotlib.

Interpreted coefficients to understand feature impact.

**How to Run**

Install required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn.

Run the Python script or Jupyter notebook.

View model evaluation and regression plots.

**What I Learned**

The difference between simple and multiple regression.

How to train and evaluate linear models.

The meaning of regression coefficients.

How to interpret model accuracy using error metrics.

**Submission**

This repository is submitted as part of the Elevate AI & ML Internship - Task 3.
